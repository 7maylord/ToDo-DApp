# To-Do DApp

A decentralized To-Do application built on Ethereum using React, Vite, and Ethers.js. This DApp allows users to manage their tasks on the blockchain with functionalities such as adding, deleting, and retrieving tasks.

## Features

- **Decentralized Task Management**: Store tasks securely on the Ethereum blockchain.
- **Wallet Integration**: Connect and interact with smart contracts via wallets(Metamask)
- **Live Blockchain Updates**: Fetch tasks dynamically from the blockchain.
- **Real-Time Notifications**: Get instant feedback with toast notifications.

## Requirements

To run this project, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (v16 or later recommended)
- **MetaMask Extension** (for interacting with the blockchain) or Any Wallet extension
- **Core Testnet (tCORE)** (for smart contract deployment),[ Click here to get faucet for testnet](https://scan.test.btcs.network/faucet)
- **Vite** (for fast frontend development)
- **Ethers.js** (for interacting with Ethereum blockchain)

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/7maylord/ToDo-DApp.git
   cd ToDo-DApp
   ```
2. **Install dependencies**
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. **Start the development server**
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```
4. **Open in browser**
   - Visit `http://localhost:5173/` to access the application.

## Usage

1. **Connect Wallet**: Click on the "Connect Wallet" button to connect MetaMask.
2. **Fetch Tasks**: The app automatically fetches tasks from the blockchain.
3. **Add Task**: Enter a task title and description, then click "Add Task" to store it on the blockchain.
4. **Delete Task**: Click the "Delete" button next to a task to remove it from the blockchain.

## Smart Contract

The smart contract for this DApp is deployed on the **Core Testnet**. Ensure that your MetaMask is connected to the same network to interact with the contract.
